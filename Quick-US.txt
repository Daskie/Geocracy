1. As a player, I want to swipe with one finger to rotate the world, so that I can easily navigate the game space.

2. As an attacking player, I want the countries I can attack from my selected country to be indicated, so that I can quickly see what my options are.

3. As a player, I want the shape and arrangement of the continents and countries to be different from game to game, so that each game is a new experience.
