//Move your pieces to different territories
// at the end of your turn. It is in your best interest
// to move pieces to your border territories that are
// more vulnerable to attacks by your opponents.
// There are two rules on how you can move your pieces:

//Standard Rule: Move any number of army pieces from a
// single territory into an adjacent territory occupied by you.

//Alternate Rule: You can move pieces anywhere,
// as long as the starting point and destination can be
// reached by going through a string of adjacent territories under your control

//Remember to leave at least one army piece behind. In order to retain control
// of the territories that you are moving army pieces from,
// make sure that you leave at least one of your army pieces on each territory
// that you own. Otherwise, you will no longer have control of the territory.
