//Decide how many armies you are going to use in your attack.
// Because your territory must be occupied at all times,
// you must leave at least one army behind.
// The number of armies you attack with will determine
// how many dice you get to roll when you square off the
// opponent whose territory you are defending.
//1 army = 1 die
//2 armies = 2 dice
//3 armies = 3 dice
