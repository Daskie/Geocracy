// the same number of white dice as the number of troops
// in their defending territory, with a maximum of two.
//Match up the highest red die with the highest white die,
// and match the second highest red die with the second
// highest white die. If there is only one white die,
// only match up the highest red die with the white die.
//Remove one of your pieces from the attacking territory
// if the white die is higher or equal to its corresponding red die.
// Remove one of your opponentâ€™s pieces from the defending
// territory if the red die is higher to its corresponding white die.
