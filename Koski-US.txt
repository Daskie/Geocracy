1. As a new user, I want a step by step tutorial my first time playing, so I can understand
how to use all parts of the game.

2. As a user, I want to be able to save my game progress, so I can come back to my game
without having to start over.

3. As a veteran user, I want to be able to specify whether I want the step by step tutorial
when I start a new game, so I donâ€™t have to read the instructions everytime.
