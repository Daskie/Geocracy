1. As a user, I want to have the option to play in single-player mode, so that I don't need to make arrangements to play with other people. 
2. As a beginner, I want to be provided with instructions at the beginning of the game, so I can easily learn how to play. 
3. As a player, I want to have the option to pause the game at anytime, so I can take a break and resume later.
